Hey <%= @business.first_name %>,

I wanted to let you know that after nearly four years, I'm shutting down RailsDevs.

It's been a great ride - thousands of developers signed up, dozens of companies hired through the platform, and I had the privilege of watching new teams and products come to life.

Thank you for being a part of it, whether you hired someone, messaged a developer, or just created an account. Even if we didn't work together directly, your interest helped shape the platform and push it forward.

If you want to stay connected then please send me an email: joe@masilotti.com

Thanks again for being part of the journey.
