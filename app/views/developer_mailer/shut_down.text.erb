Hey <%= @developer.first_name %>,

After almost four years, I'm shutting down RailsDevs. The site will go offline on August 15.

I started RailsDevs to help Ruby and Rails developers get discovered by businesses - and it worked! Dozens of developers found jobs, and many more had meaningful conversations that started with a RailsDevs profile.

From day one, RailsDevs has been developer-first. It was my small attempt to flip the hiring dynamic and give developers more control.

Running this site changed my life. It kickstarted my indie journey and helped me connect with incredible Rubyists like you. I'm endlessly grateful for everyone who signed up, shared it, and supported me along the way.

I especially want to thank everyone who contributed to the open source codebase. Your help made RailsDevs better than I could have built alone. It was a team effort, even if it never felt like a traditional one.

This truly feels like the end of an era. Shutting it down is not a decision I made lightly, and I'm genuinely sad to see it go. But it's time for me to make space for what's next.

I've said this to developers who landed jobs through RailsDevs, and it applies just as much here: I'm honored to see RailsDevs make a difference in the world, one developer at a time.

If you want to stay in touch, the best way is to subscribe to my newsletter: https://masilotti.com/newsletter/ - that's where I'm most active.

Thanks again for being here. I hope we cross paths again soon. I'll be speaking at Rails World and would love to say hi.

P.S. I'm now working on Ruby Friends (https://rubyfriends.app), a tiny app that helps you remember who you met at conferences (without awkwardness).
